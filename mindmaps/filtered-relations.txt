storage systems - are crucial for - data to eventually go there
understanding - is crucial for - storage systems
data - is read and written - in blocks rather than individual bytes
metadata - includes - size of the file
data organization - is important within - storage systems
file size - is - metadata
metadata - represents - the size of a file
file - is measured in - kilobytes
metadata - includes - information
metadata - distinguishes - file
file - contains - data
storage systems - use - units of 1024 bytes
block allocation - is essential in - storage systems
understanding - is essential in - storage systems
system - allocates - specific number of blocks

tracks - consists of - sectors
sectors - help in - efficiently locating and accessing data
hard disk drives - experience - rotational latency
latency - is approximately half of - full rotation
hard disk drives - have seek latency - when locating a specific track on a disk
latency - has two types - "Access" and "Average"
bandwidth - measured in - megabytes per second
bandwidth - indicates - rate of data transfer on a storage system
bandwidth - dominates - sequential workflow
system - spends more time on - data transmission
latency - impacts - time for data transmission
seeking and rotating - delay - system
latency - plays a crucial role in - how long it takes to access and transmit data
data - can be transmitted among diverse blocks - in a random workflow
system - spends more time on - seeking and waiting for data access
latency - dominates in - a random workflow

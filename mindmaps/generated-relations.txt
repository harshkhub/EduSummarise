file systems - are part of - the foundation
data - goes - to storage systems
file systems - consist of - files
file systems - showcase - the importance of data organization
file systems - include - Metadata
data - Lost - Unsaved
ssd - functions as - a storage area for working data
ssd - needs data read into - main memory
latency - refers to - waiting time for data access
latency - refers to - time required for device to get ready
bandwidth - determines - data transmission capacity
latency - impacts - data access speed
bandwidth - impacts - overall system performance
hard disk drives - consist of - platters with multiple surfaces
hard disk drives - have a rotation speed - measured in RPM (rotations per minute)
hard disk drives - rotate at speeds - 10,000 RPM
data - is read and written in - entire sectors
hard disk drives - use - address schemes
hard disk drives - involve - CHS addressing
hard disk drives - rotate - causing worst-case latency
file systems - have - best-case latency
latency - is approximately half of - full rotation
hard disk drives - have - seek latency
bandwidth - measured in - megabytes per second
bandwidth - indicates - rate of data transfer on a storage system
bandwidth - dominates - sequential workflow
latency - plays a crucial role in - how long it takes to access and transmit data
data - can be accessed and transmitted among diverse blocks by - dividing the block size by the bandwidth
latency - dominates - random workflow
ssd - consists of - multiple memory chips
ssd - contains - multiple dies
data - is written and read - in pages
data - is stored - as a charge in the floating gate
ssd - involves - writing data
ssd - involves - reading entire pages
ssd - requires - adjusting the charge
ssd - updated by - performing a full block erase
data - typically - updated by performing a full block erase
ssd - involves - changing data states within the cells from 1 to 0
ssd - involves - programming
